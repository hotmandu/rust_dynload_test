Simple Rust Dynamic Loading Test
===

Run `cargo run loader` in the root directory to launch.

Try `simpcnt`, `reduce` or `timer` command to test.

### Memo
As I am new to Rust and `abi_stable` crate and I just wanted simple working code,  
the code may contain unsound, unsafe and 'smelly' parts.  
I might fix them and write better code later.
